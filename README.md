# Zhonyas - A League of Legends Discord Bot
**Zhonyas is now deprecated, and combined with [Cubchoo](https://github.com/dain98/Cubchoo-disc).**

Zhonyas, an instance of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), is a multi-purpose League of Legends Discord bot. With it, you can do things such as:
 - Add and track each of your accounts in a Discord channel, where the bot will output a pretty embed message every time you win/lose a game
 - Look up summoner details, including match history
 - Look up champion details/builds/runes using champion.gg
 - More features to come!


You can add Zhonyas to your server using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=459894658919694356&scope=bot) invite link.
